At long last! I got the final commitment from my boss. We'll be moving down the path of rebuilding "BiQ":http://www.biq.dk using "Ruby on Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.org. Goodbye stupid ASP, hello sweet Ruby.

Our preliminary tests shows that nothing we are currently doing is outside of the scope of Rails. They also show that Ruby will perform as well as, or better than, the current ASP/IIS/Windows solution - and that's when running on a lower grade machine than our production server.

In addition to preserving what's left of my sanity, this renewed BiQ should also bring us to a position where we can do a lot of interesting stuff that we want to in the future. 

I am - once again - excited about my job.
