This coming Saturday will bring about "24 hours of Rails programming mayhem":http://www.railsday2006.com/. Participating would be extremely cool and fun to boot, but I have no team or no really good ideas for a killer application. 

So uhm, anyone need a Rails developer with a flair for UI design?

+Update: That didn't take long, looks like I'll be competing in Rails day for the first time. Cool, looking forward to this.+
