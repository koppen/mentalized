Cool, I made it into the "top 40 Rails contributors":http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2007/01/railsconf_2007_cd_baby_hackfes.html in January. Which means I might end up with a free registration to the "US RailsConf 2007":http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/ and a hotel room, courtesy of "CD Baby":http://cdbaby.com/ - assuming enough of the "top 20 contributors":http://workingwithrails.com/contests/hackfest2007/winners can't make it to RailsConf.

Grats to the winners, and thanks to CD Baby for backing a contest like this.
