One of the oft-ranted about features of Rails, is the Inflector - also known as that f***** pluralizer. To turn it off, put this in your config/environment.rb, below the line that says "Include your application configuration below":

bc(ruby). ActiveRecord::Base.pluralize_table_names = false

This works in Rails 1.0, and counters seemingly weird issues where Rails can't find your tables (like the "Before updating scaffolding from new DB schema, try creating a table for your model" message from the scaffold generator).

To figure out what the pluralizer does and expects, do check out "Geoffrey Grosenbach's Pluralizer Tool":http://nubyonrails.topfunky.com/tools/pluralize.
