For the first time a Rubyism has bit me using Rails. I needed to make sure a field was set to false and not null. So I added af before_save callback to my ActiveRecord model:

bc(ruby). before_save :set_defaults
def set_defaults
  self.signup_completed = false if self.signup_completed.nil?
end

This worked great and the testcase passed. Alas, a ton of other testcases failed. Somehow adding the above prevented objects from being saved for no apparent reason. They were valid, .errors were empty, but .save still returned false.

"Jakob", I asked to myself, "what can prevent an ActiveRecord object from saving?" "Oh, many things", came the swift reply, "for example callbacks returning false, but that's certainly not the case here."

However, that is exactly the case here: Ruby methods return the last evaluated result. Since self.signup_completed = false returns false, my callback was returning false as well, which cancels the save. Doh!

h2. The solution

bc(ruby). def set_defaults
  self.signup_completed = false if self.signup_completed.nil?
  return true
end

Ugly, but working.
