I know you've all been waiting for this, and this is in absolutely no shape or form an attempt at bolstering my Google juice, no sir, so here it is, the definitive list of the most popular content on [mentalized.net](/) in 2012.

## Most popular posts

1. [5 ways to run commands from Ruby](/journal/2010/03/08/5-ways-to-run-commands-from-ruby/)

As always, the list is dominated by posts written before 2012. Not surprisingly, but it's always funny seeing this long tail of old content.

## Referring sites

Hey, it looks that social media stuff is finally taking off: That [Twitter thing](https://twitter.com) has made its way into the top 5 referring sites! Just barely.

[The Google](http://google.com) still reigns supreme as my number one traffic generator, which I suppose, fits perfectly fine with the long tail of old posts mentioned above. Google is way better at digging up old stuff when it's needed than any social stream service. The latter tends to excel at the here and now.

[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) has also appeared on the list. Understandably, when you consider many of my posts - and indeed of the popular posts - are very concrete issues one might encounter when programming.

[Bing](http://bing.com) is holding steady at number 10 referring site. That's below [Korben](http://korben.info/) - good for you, Bing...


## Browsers

Ah, yes, browser stats from a geek website, always so very applicable to every other site in existence... Nevertheless, here's the top 5 browsers on mentalized.net:

1. Chrome (53%)
2. Firefox (29%)
3. Safari (9%)
4. Internet Explorer (5%)
5. Opera (1%)

Poor Opera. And while it pains me to say this, having been an avid Firefox user for years, I am kind of surprised seeing Firefox that high on the list.

## Onwards and upwards

I know my 2012 was great, here's hoping 2013 will be just as terrific for all of us.
