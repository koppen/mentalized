Looks like someone decided to resurrect the "Railsday":http://www.railsday2006.com/ concept. While it has a different name, a different duration, a different judging process (and probably a ton of other differences), "Rails Rumble":http://railsrumble.com is still all about getting a small team together and build a kick ass web -application- thing in "Ruby on Rails":http://rubyonrails.org in a set timeframe.

Time to think up a killer idea, hmmm...
