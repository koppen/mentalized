We all know them, and we hate them all: E-mails in your inbox advertising everything from "Get rich in 5 minutes"-schemes to penis-enlargements and "free" busty blondes.

Unfortunatly I am a gullible fool and have a tendency to post my e-mail address all over the internet and sign up for all kinds of services. "Oooh, become a user - click-clickety-click-submit". Heck, I like people being able to get in touch with me, even people I do not know, but I do not want to have to scuffle through myriads of spammails to find the one interesting mail that day.

So I decided to start fighting back instead of forever silently deleting unwanted mails. Luckily my <a href="http://www.ngdc.net">email provider</a> gave me the opportunity to have my e-mail account moved to a mailserver running <a href="http://spamassassin.org/">SpamAssassin</a>, a rule-based spamfilter. All I need to do know is to sit back, setup a filtering rule in <a href="http://www.ritlabs.com/the_bat/index.html">my e-mail client</a> which could move all spam to a seperate folder, delete it, reply calling the sender a lameass goatwanker, forward to <a href="http://www.spamcop.org">Spamcop</a> or <a href="http://razor.sourceforge.net">some</a> <a href="http://mail-abuse.org/rbl/">blacklist</a> or whatever I desire.

Most important, I can go through the spam when <em>I</em> feel like it and do with it what I deem necessary. Last night I did my first submission to <a href="http://www.spamcop.org">Spamcop</a>. It locates e-mail adresses, builds and sends complaint-mails to administrators, all while protecting my precious e-mail address. Even though I realize my reporting efforts most likely are in vain, I had a smug grin on my face when Spamcop reported: "Yum, this spam is fresh".
