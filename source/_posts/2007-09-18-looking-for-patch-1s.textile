During his keynote today, and now on the Rails blog, "David":http://www.loudthinking.com explained "the new policy for getting patches into Rails":http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/2007/9/15/how-to-get-a-patch-into-rails.

Basically the new policy requires every patch to have documentation, tests and 3 supporters. It's a welcome change, especially if it means the core team have to do less legwork and apply higher quality patches.

Therefore, I am now looking for a few supporters for some of my patches. If there's anything of the below you'd like to see included in Rails, please comment on the patch, saying +1.

* "#6000: CSS-Class not assigned":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/6000 - for some reason you cannot pass html_options to date_select tags and its kin. With this patch, you can.
* "#7054: db:test:purge shouldn't rely on SQL Server command line tools":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/7054 - using SQL Server and want to run your tests on something other than Windows? With this patch, you can.

I have a few other patches sitting idle, but they might need a bit more work (read: tests) before getting supporters.
