description: "I've built an experimental photo gallery widget using HTML5, CSS, and a wee bit of JavaScript. Watch the demo here."

HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, hardware accelerated 3D transformations - this post has it all. Oh, and a live demo.

I recently had the idea of a photo carousel resembling a pile of photos being shuffled from one side of the screen to the other. The goal was to use as little JavaScript as possible and rely on CSS transitions instead.

h2. Disclaimer

This is just me messing about and kicking the tires, it's not intended to be a fully working, reusable, or customizable widget. In other words; this is not a jQuery plugin. I suppose it could be made into one fairly easily, though.


h3. Sidenote

&lt;pedantry&gt;When the heck did these types of widgets become "sliders"? "These are sliders":http://www.java2s.com/Code/JavaImages/SliderTest.PNG, the others are not. The best of them don't even slide. Calling them slideshows are a stretch even.&lt;/pedantry&gt;


h2. Features

* All animation is done by CSS.
* Most visual customization is controlled via CSS.
* Uses hardware acceleration where possible (I think).
* Should work with any element, not just images.
* Works in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. It performs best in Safari, box shadows are a drag in the other browsers.
* Should degrade reasonably gracefully in other browsers, haven't been tested there though.


h2. Known issues

* Firefox has some visual artifacts caused by rotating it seems.
* The initial animation isn't the same across browsers, and to be honest, I'd prefer it wasn't there at all.
* It probably doesn't work all that great with differently sized images.
