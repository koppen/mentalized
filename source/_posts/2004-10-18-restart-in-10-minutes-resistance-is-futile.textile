Being a good and paranoid user I naturally install any and all security patches that my kind Windows XP installation asks me to.

<!--more-->

Unfortunately some patches require me to restart my computer after installation. Primitive, but it's the Windows way, I guess. While the patches have been downloaded and installed, I have continued to use my computer and would actually prefer to not have to shut down all my applications. So when the installation asks me to reboot, I click "Reboot later" planning to shut down the machine when I leave work.

Sadly, my now not-so-kind Windows XP installation is quite insistant and continues to ask me to reboot every 15 minutes. I have 15 running applications, 36 running processes, 3 edited and unsaved documents, a gazillion opened webpages, 2 active IM conversations, and a least one active SSH connection going. I have no intention of shutting all that down, and no, I don't want to in 15 minutes either, quit bugging me, gah!
