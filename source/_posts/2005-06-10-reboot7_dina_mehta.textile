** A decentralized self-organizing system
* Social tools is the natural extension of rapid adoptation to chaotic conditions.

h2. Communication and information flows

* Skype
* Yahoo Messenger
* Blogger

h2. You dont need researchers anymore

* The subject is the research 
* The users provide data themselves
* Let them do the talking, be a fly on the wall and observe

Pitching corporate blogs

* More dialogue: more jazz

=> "We just forget boundaries exist"

Summing up

* Social tools melt cultural boundaries
* People pick up tools to meet human needs.
