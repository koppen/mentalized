"Rails 1.2.3 was released today":http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/2007/3/14/rails-1-2-3-compatible-with-ruby-1-8-6-and-other-fixes, primarily to fix a few bugs and compatibility issues with the recently released Ruby 1.8.6.

Since the Rails team doesn't provide an aggregate changelog and I was going through the individual changelogs to see what had changed, I figured I might as well post the changes for y'all to see.
