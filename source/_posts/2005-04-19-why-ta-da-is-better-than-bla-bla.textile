Having followed the "Ruby on Rails weblog(Ruby on Rails weblog)":http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/ I've known about "Bla-bla List(Bla-bla List)":http://blablalist.com/ for some time now. However it's "appearance on Forever Geek(Bla-bla List at Forever Geek)":http://forevergeek.com/open_source/blabla_list.php made me figure I'd give the application a shot and try it out for size.

Now, I won't get into the "technical side of the arguments(Ruby on Rails weblog: Bla-bla list cloning a Ruby on Rails app in RIFE)":http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/03/19/bla-bla-list-cloning-a-rails-app-in-rife/, but Bla-bla List fails to even come close to competing with the experience of using "Ta-da List(Ta-da List)":http://tadalist.com.

h2. Reasons Ta-da'ing beats Bla-bla'ing

* My scroll wheel actually scrolls
* I can copy/paste parts of my lists
* Newly added items don't appear in seemingly random places on the list
* Doesn't force new windows on me
* I can use my back and print buttons
* Navigating "up" (Shift + Up) gives me the next sensible part of the hierarchy
* I can go directly to my lists from a bookmark
* Popup dialogs are actually popup dialogs, not something floating inside the window
* Confirmation dialog has buttons in a sane order (Yes to the left)
* My browsers autocompletion and username/password remembering features work
* I can control my fontsize and colors
* HTML > Flash

(This list is naturally also available as "a shared list(Why Ta-da List > Bla-bla List)":http://blablalist.com/list/jakob/WhyTa-daIsBetterThanBla-bla.)

By heavy use of Flash Bla-bla List not only fails to create an application that technically isn't comparable to Ta-da List, but also fails to provide a user experience that comes to close the one of Ta-da List.
