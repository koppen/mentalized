<ul>
  <li>People including totally unrelated text or links in emails, ie when replying to an old mail instead of starting a new one or when forwarding mails.</li>

  <li>People thinking that 10&deg;C is warm enough to open half the windows for hours on end.</li>

  <li>People taking the last coffee and having the nerve to not brew a new pot. We can develop software for cellphones that's good enough to be used by airline pilots, but can't work a manual mr. coffee...</li>
</ul>
