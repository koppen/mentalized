I am a big fan of podcasts. I have roughly one hour of daily bicycling to and from work, and roughly the same amount of walking the dog, both of which are perfect time to listen to podcasts.

My "brother":http://dualmind.dk recently asked me for podcast recommendations and I figured I might as well share my podcast playlist with him, you, and the rest of the world.
