To some people Rails have a fairly high learning curve. And certainly, it's somewhat higher than, say, PHP. However, in the longer run learning Rails definitely pays off. 

This is a step by step tutorial to getting over the first hurdle: Creating a "hello world" application in Ruby on Rails. 

<!--more-->

It works in Rails 1.0 assuming you have ruby and rails already installed and working on your system:

# @rails hello@
# @cd hello@
# @ruby script\generate controller hello@
# Create a file called index.rhtml in app/views/hello, containing "Hello world".
# @ruby script\server@
# Navigate to "http://localhost:3000/hello":http://localhost:3000/hello in your browser and be greeted with your friendly application: "Hello world"

PS: "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000/ is a lot prettier "Hello world"-ish page.
