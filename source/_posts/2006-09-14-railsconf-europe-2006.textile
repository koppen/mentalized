"Railsconf Europe 2006":http://europe.railsconf.com/ opened today and is now well underway. Unfortunately, I did not get to go there, however "Jesper":http://justaddwater.dk and other members of "Copenhagen.rb":http://copenhagenrb.dk are there, and "Jesper is liveblogging the event":http://copenhagenrb.dk/2006/9/14/railsconf-europe-session-overviews on "copenhagenrb.dk":http://copenhagenrb.dk.

Good job, Jesper!
