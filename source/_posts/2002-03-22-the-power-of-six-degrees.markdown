I just had an email arrive in my inbox. That itself is not particularily special nor interesting, however the sender was a person who seems to be existing in the outer rim of my own, little, personal world. For some reason our lives seem to cross paths once a year or so.

What strikes me as interesting about this whole deal, is the way he found me. Apparently he followed a chain of blogging links from one of his friends <a href="http://www.interbreed.org/">blog</a> and ended up looking at this digitalized version of my life. The power of <a href="http://backissues.worldlink.co.uk/articles/250100180310/22.htm">Six Degrees Of Separation</a> in full effect.
