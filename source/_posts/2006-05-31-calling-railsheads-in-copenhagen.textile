Thursday, June 29th, at 20:30 we ("Jesper RÃ¸nn-Jensen":http://justaddwater.dk and "I":https://mentalized.net) would very much like to see anyone with a passion for Rails at some unspecified location in Copenhagen.

It's just going to be a casual and relaxed meetup to see how many people around these parts would be interested in this, perhaps even on a regular'ish basis.

Do head on over to "Jespers blog":http://justaddwater.dk/2006/05/31/ruby-on-rails-copenhagen-meetup/ and sign up or sound off.
