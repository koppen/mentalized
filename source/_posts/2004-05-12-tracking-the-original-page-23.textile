Some days ago the Page 23 concept was infecting the blogosphere on end, including "this very journal(Page 23)":https://mentalized.net/journal/2004/04/15/page-23/. In short people all over the world were posting a set of instructions and a quote from a nearby book.

Inspired by a comment by "J(arcana imperii)":http://arcimperii.blogspot.com/ to my Page 23 meme, claiming the instructions had mutated somewhere along the way, I started clicking back through the history of Page 23, trying to trace the single, original page 23 post.

Unfortunately, after nearly 20 blogs/journals/diaries my search ends in a loop. A few people insist they were inspired by each other, and the backtracking trail ends at "a friends only LiveJournal(SeamusD)":http://www.livejournal.com/users/seamusd/.

So the most original instructions I have been able to dig up are from "Cyn's LiveJournal(cynnerth)":http://www.livejournal.com/users/cynnerth/1180966.html and are the exact same ones as I and everybody else have posted:

# Grab the nearest book.
# Open the book to page 23.
# Find the fifth sentence.
# Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.

Yeah, somewhat a waste of time doing this, but kind of interesting trying to trace this, and I sure got to see a lot of different blogs that I'd never have seen otherwise.

The full path that I have been able to trace looks like this:

The latter is a friends only journal, but according to "a comment (Cyn)":http://www.livejournal.com/users/cynnerth/1180966.html?thread=8736038#t8736038 he got it from kricker (#16), and we start looping.
