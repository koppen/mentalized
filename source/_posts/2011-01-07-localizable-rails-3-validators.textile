"Rails 3":http://rubyonrails.org introduced a new style of validators that allow us to group validations for each attribute into their own line. It also became easy to "create our own, custom validators":http://www.perfectline.ee/blog/building-ruby-on-rails-3-custom-validators. 

This a small tip, perhaps even a best practice, when doing so.

Most the examples I've seen around the web ends up adding errors to the errors array using something like 

bc(ruby). record.errors[attribute] << (options[:message] || "is not valid") 

Unfortunately doing it this way means your validator doesn't behave like the standard validators and the error message cannot be localized. 

Instead, please use 

bc(ruby). record.errors.add(attribute, (options[:message] || :invalid))

Using a Symbol rather than a String lets you localize the validation message via your standard "Rails I18n":http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html mechanism. It also lets you pass a proc to :message, allowing for things like <code>Time.now</code> to be used within an error message.

Thank you in advance from those of us who create non-English apps.
