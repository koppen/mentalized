Yesterday I got bit by this fairly obscure behavior in "ActiveRecord":http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html:

bc(ruby). >> person = Person.first
=> #<Person id: 1, name: "Jakob", height: 170, created_at: "2010-01-22 08:57:02", updated_at: "2010-01-22 08:58:57">
>> person.height = 169,5
=> [169, 5]
>> person.height
=> 1

Uhm, huh?

The above is from "Rails":http://rubyonrails.org 2.3.5 using "SQLite":http://sqlite.org/, but I originally saw the issue running on "PostgreSQL":http://postgresql.org.

It turns out, that if the object you assign to an integer attribute/column does not respond to <code>to_i</code>, the attribute will be set to 1 - unless the object evaluates to <code>false</code> in which case the attribute will be set to 0.

My best guess is that ActiveRecord is trying to work around the lack of boolean columns in MySQL with this. So even though I am not using MySQL I still have to suffer its ineptitude. One just can't win.
