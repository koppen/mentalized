Quick tip: If you want to run your Rails test suite through Rake on Windows using SQL Server, you need to have the scptxfr.exe utility in your path. On our development server, which is a pretty standard Microsoft SQL Server 2000 install, it's located in C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL\Upgrade.

And for the sake of completness, on Windows 2000 you change your path variable on My Computer > Properties > Advanced > Environment variables > System Variables. Only command prompts created after the fact will reflect that change.
