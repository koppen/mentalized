I want to get into using "Ajax(Adaptive Path)":http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php. I want to get more "Ruby on Rails(Ruby on Rails)":http://www.rubyonrails.com/ experience. I want an online place to post my thoughts and notes since my memory isn't quite reliable.

If you think the above sounds like something that should be combined into a project, you are right, and I did just that. To make it even more interesting, I've decided to share my progress with you and the rest of the world.

h2. The idea and goals

I've named the project Notetagger, since that's what it is. I want to be able to add notes and categorize them notes by tagging. Fear my creative naming skills.

Notetagger is primarily meant to be a way for me to get into Ajax and generally polish my Ruby on Rails skills, secondarily I'd like it to become an application I wouldn't mind using.


h2. You call this planning?

Being a project for myself only, and one I have a pretty good grasp of what I want to do, the initial discovery and design phase was pretty easily covered. I set the following feature list for the application:

* Simple, lightweight
* Write notes
* Read notes
* Tag notes
* Manage notes

I also cooked up a simple HTML mockup of how I imagined the application to look and behave, and then I started digging into the code.
