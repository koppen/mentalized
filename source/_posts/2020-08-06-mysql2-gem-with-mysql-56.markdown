description: "If you get an 'unknown option '--include' message when installing the mysql2, this might just be the fix."

This is one of those posts that's written as my extended memory. I ran into an
issue trying to install the [mysql2 gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/mysql2) on a
client project today running [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) 5.6 (yeah yeah, I
know). The root issue wasn't immediately obvious, but I managed to find a
workaround.

## What I experienced

The gist of the issue is this behaviour (I've included the full error output
down below):

    $ gem install mysql2 -v 0.5.3
    ...
    /opt/local/bin/mysql_config: unknown option '--include'
    ...
    *** extconf.rb failed ***

It seems the relevant error message here is:

    /opt/local/bin/mysql_config: unknown option '--include'

which matches what happens when I try it manually:

    $ /opt/local/bin/mysql_config --version
    /opt/local/bin/mysql_config Ver 1.0 Distrib 5.6.45, for osx10.14 on x86_64

    $ /opt/local/bin/mysql_config --include
    /opt/local/bin/mysql_config: unknown option '--include'

Installing the gem with MySQL 5.7 activated works just fine, because:

    $ /opt/local/bin/mysql_config --include
    -I/opt/local/include/mysql57/mysql

Now, this is weird because `mysql_config` most definitely should have an
`--include` option according to the [man
page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/mysql_config):

    o   --include

        Compiler options to find MySQL include files.

## Root cause

It seems the `mysql_config` binary gets linked incorrectly when doing `port select
mysql`. The symlink is now pointing to something unexpected:

    ls -l /opt/local/bin/mysql_config
    lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  46 Aug  6 11:50 /opt/local/bin/mysql_config -> /opt/local/lib/mysql56/bin/mysql_config_editor

That link probably shouldn't go to `mysql_config_editor`, but to
`/opt/local/lib/mysql56/bin/mysql_config`. Luckily the workaround isn't
problematic now we know the root cause:

## Fix

To work around the issue describe above, we can instruct mysql2 where to find
our `mysql_config` binary:

    $ gem install mysql2 -v "0.5.3" -- --with-mysql-config=/opt/local/lib/mysql56/bin/mysql_config
    Fetching mysql2-0.5.3.gem
    Building native extensions with: '--with-mysql-config=/opt/local/lib/mysql56/bin/mysql_config'
    This could take a while...
    Successfully installed mysql2-0.5.3
    1 gem installed

Let this be a reminder to always verify your assumptions. I assumed, quite
logically I might add, that the `mysql_config` binary in my PATH was the binary
I was looking for. It wasn't.

## System details

- macOS Mojave 10.14.6
- Macports 2.6.3
