As posted previously we've been looking to "buy a printer for the home office":https://mentalized.net/journal/2005/11/23/looking-for-printer-shopping-advice/. We ended up buying a "Brother DCP-340CW":http://www.brother.com/europe/fax/info/dcp340cw/dcp340cw-ove.html from "enavia.com":http://enavia.com. It arrived yesterday and these are my initial impressions.

The DCP-340CW is one of those multifunction types of gizmos: It -cooks, stirs, and fries-prints, scans, and copies. It does suffer from being a jack of all trades, master of none, and seems to be a clear tribute to the fact that you can only get two, not all of quality, good price, and many features.

h2. Downsides

* The prints are slighty fuzzy around the edges.
* The scans have slighty visible vertical lines.
* It isn't - as far as I can tell - terribly fast (20 pages per minute in black'n'white prints).


h2. Upsides

* It connects to cabled or wireless ethernet. Being able to put it anywhere in the apartment without having to worry about anything but power cables is going to be a blessing.
* Works without issues with both the Windows machines and the iBook.
* It's cheap.
