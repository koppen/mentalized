"MedBillManager":http://www.medbillmanager.com makes dealing with medical bills easier and allows you to compare what you're paying with what others are paying.

MedBillManager is a little (well not quite that small) something that I've been working on over the last couple of months. I did most of the backend stuff together with Wilkes Joiner and Matthew Beale, while "Matt Mueller":http://thatmatt.com/ dealt with the front end.

It's the first "Rails":http://rubyonrails.org application developed primarily by "Substance Lab":https://substancelab.com and I've been working with Christopher on it since the beginning so it feels really good getting it out the door.
