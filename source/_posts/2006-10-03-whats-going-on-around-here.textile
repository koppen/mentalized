It's been pretty quiet around these parts lately - if you ignore the posts about Copenhagen.rb meetings at least. That's primarily because I am having "tons of fun at work":https://mentalized.net/journal/2006/07/11/biq-on-rails-its-a-go/, which for some reason doesn't leave me much time for blogging. Not that I would ever think of blogging at work, no siree...

Anyways, here are some tidbits about what's be going around my life recently:

* The "BiQ":http://www.biq.dk rewrite is going really well, and I am thoroughly enjoying this.
* "Copenhagen Ruby Brigade":http://copenhagenrb.dk has taken off and the two meetings so far have been visited by 20-25 Ruby heads. I'm really enjoying these meetings and the more social side of software.
* My girlfriend started blogging - primarily for a school project, but it will be interesting to see if she keeps blogging.
* "Substance Lab":https://substancelab.com is busy with "client work":http://medbillmanager.com.
* "The puppy is growing bigger":https://flickr.com/photos/jakobs/257479084/in/photostream/ - she's almost a real dog now.
