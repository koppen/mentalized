On any given day, when I am sitting at home after work, I can be contacted through 2 different instant messengers, 3 different email accounts (with a multitude of aliases each) and on 2 different IRC-networks (where I am on around 10 channels). Talk about being desperate for communication. Funny thing is, when somebody I don't know tries to contact me, I usually ignore him/her.
