description: "Live comment previews are fun and cool"

Update: Ah well, it was a fun experiment, but I've decided to scrap it again, possible in favor of something pure Javascript'ish. The AJAX preview is either too unresponsive to be worthwhile or I send way too many requests against MT/MySQL that I am comfortable with on a shared server.

Thanks to the wonders of "Sam Stephensons Prototype":http://prototype.conio.net/, "Movable Types":http://movabletype.org comment preview template and AJAX, I am now sporting live comment previews.

"Go check it out":/journal/2005/06/14/ajaxified-live-comment-preview/#comments.

There is an issue at the moment: It seems Movable Types comment preview doesn't adhere to the settings I have set for stripping HTML, so some HTML elements might show up in the preview, but be stripped in the final comment. Bad, I know.

So far I've only got around to checking it in Firefox, but I think Prototype is my saviour here, and I assume the previews will work in all Javascript enabled browsers that support asynchronous XMLHTTPRequest - ie IE6, Firefox, Safari (I believe).

If you don't have one of those browsers, well... "What are you waiting for?":http://getfirefox.com
