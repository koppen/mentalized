The following are quotes from an actual email conversation with a potential customer.

bq. I'm no fan of bullshit NDAs, so I'm just sending this and I trust you that this'll not end up on Twitter or anything

bq. I know quality has its price. [...] I don't like the wheeling and dealing either. If you say it's your rate, it's your rate

bq. We would certainly not be against contributing back to the [open source] community

I _must_ close this deal.
