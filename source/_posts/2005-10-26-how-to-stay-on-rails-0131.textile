In these times where "Rails 1.0 Release Candidates":http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/10/25/rails-1-0-rc3-0-14-2-a-bunch-of-little-things introduce "memory leaks":http://weblog.textdrive.com/article/178/fun, bugs, and whatnot, you might want to lock your Rails application to a tried and tested version.

In your config/environment.rb, change your require_gem lines from

bc. require 'active_support'
require 'active_record'
require 'action_controller'
require 'action_mailer'
require 'action_web_service'

to

bc. require_gem 'activesupport', '= 1.1.1'
require_gem 'activerecord', '= 1.11.1'
require_gem 'actionpack', '= 1.9.1'
require_gem 'actionmailer', '= 1.0.1'
require_gem 'actionwebservice', '= 0.8.1'
require_gem 'rails', '= 0.13.1'

and you'll be rolling on Rails 0.13.1 until you decide not to. Best way to make sure breakage doesn't happen when your host decides to upgrade without warning you.
