h2. iTerm shell script

A bunch of people pointed to "this handy iTerm shortcut":http://railstips.org/2008/2/22/handy-iterm-shortcut, which uses Applescript invoked from a shell script to start the environment. I use roughly the same approach, however it's wrapped in "an Automator workflow":https://mentalized.net/files/journal/rails_project_launcher/EditRailsProjectWorkflow.zip, which I launch using "Quicksilver":http://docs.blacktree.com/quicksilver/what_is_quicksilver.


h2. Automator workflow

Basically what the workflow does is ask me to pick a project, then it fetches the most recent version of the application, runs any missing migrations, starts script/server and "autotest":http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/, launches "TextMate":http://macromates.com/ with the project source, and iTerm with the most recent commit messages, the test log and the development log. This saves me so many keypresses.

It's a modified version of a workflow I found somewhere on the net. Unfortunately I cannot find the original source now, so I cannot even give credit where it's due. "Download it here":https://mentalized.net/files/journal/rails_project_launcher/EditRailsProjectWorkflow.zip.


h2. View it in action

You can see it in action below (the text is terribly hard to read unfortunately, but it shows how the process looks at least):
