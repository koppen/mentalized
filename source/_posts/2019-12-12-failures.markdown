I've built stuff online pretty much since I figured out that I could. Join me on a tour through my the projects I have built where I planned on building a thriving side business - and failed.

## FUNsummer

The first ever internet-based venture I started working on was back when the internet was quite new and no one really knew all that much about it. It was a marketplace for people renting out their cottages for vacations, so I guess, kind of like [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com) ;)

This was in 1996 probably and I had no clue what I was doing. I just knew that the world wide web was awesome, [Yahoo!](https://www.yahoo.com/) was the shit, and that my parents had a cottage they wanted to rent out. We didn't even have an internet connection at home, so I rode my bicycle to the local library with a floppy disk in my backpack to upload changes to the site.

I had no marketing plan, and the only customer I knew of was family. Probably not the best approach. But I did have price tag on it, and the payment was a yearly subscription. Man, I was so ahead of my time...

### What did I learn?

- I can actually build things and put them online.
- Building things and putting them online isn't enough...

## DiabloII.dk

This was pretty much a passion-project, as I remember it. I was an avid gamer and [Diablo II](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/games/d2/) was coming out. So I started a danish fan-site for it. I don't recall what my goals were, probably just that I wanted to see if I could build something that grew popular. It never really did, but I did get some traffic because I had the sweet domain.

In the end, the site ended up being rolled into a larger gaming site, [Daily Rush](https://www.dailyrush.dk), run by a certain [David Heinemeier Hansson](https://dhh.dk/), who'd later end up building [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org), running [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com), and racing race cars. I ended up working for Daily Rush more or less directly because of my building [DiabloII.dk](http://diabloii.dk) - but as a standalone business it never took off.

### What did I learn?

- I can build stuff that people actually like and use.
- Having some kind of plan or idea for how to make money in the long run is a good idea.

## Guildspace

This was my first, real attempt at a SaaS business. Still in the online gaming space, this time I was looking at setting up a website for a [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/) guild. I had been running the website for my [Everquest](https://www.everquest.com) guild for years, and I knew how much of a pain this was, so I figured if I am about to build a website for my own guild anyways, why not make it generic so other guilds can use the platform?

At its prime, I had 3 or 4 guilds using it; all family and friends, but I did manage to get a few of them to pay monthly. Eventually my interest in World of Warcraft died down, the guild I was running died down, and the application died down.

### What did I learn?

- Scratching your own itch is a decent way to find a market.
- Having people pay regularly for a product is awesome.
- PayPal is bad.

## FlowToDo

Ah, to do lists... we all have our special needs, right? FlowToDo was my attempt at making a to do list application that suited my needs perfectly. It was a mix of [Mark Hursts](https://twitter.com/markhurst) ideas from [Good Todo](https://goodtodo.com) - in that you could send emails into the application and schedule tasks into the future - and prioritisation ideas from [Dave Seahs](https://twitter.com/daveseah) [Printable CEO series](https://davidseah.com/2005/11/the-printable-ceo-series/).

I still think the result was decent and I used it for a long while to schedule my own tasks. In the end, though, To Do lists are a crowded market, and with no marketing plan or overall vision I never got around to actually marketing it. And with competitors like [Flow](https://www.getflow.com/), [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/), and [Todoist](https://todoist.com) able to execute way better than I could on many of the same ideas, I ended up shutting it down.

### What did I learn?

- It is possible to exist in a crowded market but actually selling is hard if you aren't 100% clear on your unique selling points.
- Complicated rules and algorithms are hard to explain and doesn't make for good unique sellings points.

## Objectpush

While building FlowToDo it became apparent that receiving emails in web applications really wasn't as easy as it could have been. FlowToDo would actually log into an [email server](https://www.emailsherpa.net/knows/email-server/), check for new emails, and download them via POP like any other [email client](https://www.emailsherpa.net/knows/email-client/). This was cumbersome and error prone and required an email account somewhere.

So I partnered with [Laust](https://object.io/) to build Objectpush; an API/webhook based way of receiving emails. Basically we'd receive the email for you and send you a HTTP request with the contents. The idea was simple enough and it suited our developer mindset.

In the end, we gave up when we saw this being added as features of the big incumbents like [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/), [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) etc. Also dedicated services were popping up that did exactly what we did; the major difference was that they actually had a working product.

### What did I learn?

- Having a partner is awesome, but it is no a guarantee for anything.
- Technology is irrelevant, regardless of how well built and well designed it is, if no one knows about it.

## Conclusion

In the end, I am not sure what to conclude from all of this; for the most part this is just me reminiscing. Perhaps it is just a curious part of my history, perhaps there's a trendline.

Who we are today is determined by our previous experiences. And none of the above experiences would I have preferred to be without. Hopefully one of these days I might be able to write a "Successes" post, pointing at the above experiences laying the foundation.
