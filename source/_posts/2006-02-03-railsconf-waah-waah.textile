So "RailsConf 2006 registration has opened":http://www.railsconf.org/articles/2006/02/02/registration-is-open. Boy oh boy, would I like to go. But clocking in at minimum $400 for registration and a lot more for travelling expenses I can't justify it. "The side job":https://substancelab.com doesn't currently make enough money for that, and "the day job":http://www.biq.dk doesn't use Rails.

Blast.
