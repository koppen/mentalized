<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/" title="Apple iPod">iPods</a> have always been sexy - period. 3rd generation iPods are even sexier: Smaller, with more storage space (up to 30GB, drool) and now with easily usable play-control buttons and a kinky docking station. Somehow I think it's a good idea my bankaccount isn't bulging with unspent cash or I'd end up buying one of those babies.</p>

<p>Add to this the whole <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/" title="Apple iTunes">iTunes 4</a> / <a href="http://www.apple.com/music/store/" title="Apple iTunes Music Store">Music Store</a> deal and the temptation is almost too big. Unfortunatly the Music Store is not available for Windows <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/39/30437.html" title="The Register: Apple launches 99c a song music service">yet</a> (after all Apple is a hardware vendor with their own OS and hardware), and what's even worse it <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000142.html" title="Loud Thinking: American iTunes life">is unavailable to people outside the US</a>. I realize that teaming with the music industry BigCo's probably doesn't give Steve and Co all the flexibility they want, and that localization may be an issue, but I hate being treated as a <a href="http://mentalized.net/journal/archives/movies/us-customers-only-please/" title="US customers only, please">secondrank consumer</a> because of my geographical location.</p>

<p>Hopefully this great initiative is going to be a success for both Apple and the <a href="http://www.riaa.org/About-Members-1.cfm" title="RIAA Membership list">RIAA godfathers</a>, showing the media <a href="/journal/2002/10/23/musical-dinosaurs/" title="Musical dinosaurs">dinosaurs</a> that there is a bold new world out here, with myriads of people wanting to actually pay for - not steal - their products.</p>
