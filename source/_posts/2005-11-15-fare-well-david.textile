Last night "a bunch of people said goodbye":http://pinds.com/articles/2005/11/15/emigrationsafhandling-worth-doing to "David":http://www.loudthinking.com, all while trying to prive whatever information we could from that impressive (and loud) mind of his.

Selected highlights from David's emigration speech/presentation/keynote/whachamacallit:

* Danish mediocricy-loving and taxes pushed him towards the states.
* Open sourcing Rails was a fantastic idea.
* "Reality PR" requires a thick hide and bombastic opinions.
* We ain't seen the best of Rails yet.

Thanks bundles to "Lars Pind":http://pinds.com, "Thomas Madsen-Mygdal":http://www.bootstrapping.net/, "Martin von Haller":http://suse.groenbaek.net/openlife/, "Nikolaj Nyholm":http://nyholm.net/decibel/, and "Guan Yang":http://unicast.org/ for organizing that little shindig. Oh, and thanks to Gert from "
