My longest running client, "change:healthcare":https://changehealthcare.com, has been "featured on the CNN website":http://edition.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/09/25/ep.cutting.health.costs/index.html and is "scheduled to appear on air":http://company.changehealthcare.com/blog/cnn-thanks/ this weekend - what a great achievement.

I've worked with Christopher, one of the founders, and the rest of "the team":http://company.changehealthcare.com/company-bios/ for the last few years, going from a static website with just 5 pages to an increasingly complex Ruby on Rails application helping people make sense of their medical bills and providers.

These guys (and gals) are the real deal. They are in this to change healthcare for the better - "publishing a free PDF book":http://www.myhealthcareiskillingme.com/ and getting on CNN are just a few of the steps on the way.

Congratulations.
