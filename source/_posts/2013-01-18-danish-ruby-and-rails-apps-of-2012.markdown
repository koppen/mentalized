While the danish Ruby on Rails community [isn't as big as it should be](https://mentalized.net/journal/2011/08/11/the-state-of-ruby-in-denmark/), we're far from an inactive bunch.

With help from the Ruby user groups in [Copenhagen](http://copenhagenrb.dk) and [Aarhus](http://aarhus.rb) I've compiled this list of danish sites/apps built on Rails and launched (more or less) in 2012.
