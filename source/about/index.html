  <h1>Jakob Skjerning</h1>

  <p>
    Hello. My name is Jakob Skjerning, and you have stumbled across my online
    home.
  </p>

  <p>
    I tweet as <a href="https://twitter.com/mentalizer" rel="me">@mentalizer</a> and
    email from <a href="mailto:jakob@mentalized.net">jakob@mentalized.net</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Blogger</h2>

  <p>
    Over the years, I have written about
    {% assign categories = site.categories | sort %}
    {% for category in categories %}
      <a href="/journal/{{category | first | slugify}}/">{{category | first}}</a>,
    {% endfor %}
    and a few other tidbits.
  </p>

  <h2>Digital agency owner</h2>

  <p>
    I am the <a href="http://dk.linkedin.com/in/jakobskjerning/" title="Jakob Skjerning on Linked In" rel="me">CEO and founder</a> of <a href="https://substancelab.com">Substance
    Lab</a> &mdash; a digital agency building successful web applications for
    startups and small businesses.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have worked professionally with the web since 2000, and I am particularly
    interested in user centric websites and beautiful code.
  </p>

  <h2>Open source contributor</h2>

  <p>
    I have written a few, and contributed to more, open source projects,
    primarily ones written in Ruby. My open source contributions are all on <a
    href="https://github.com/koppen" title="Jakob Skjerning on GitHub"
    rel="me">my GitHub profile</a>.

  <h2>Hobbyist photographer</h2>
